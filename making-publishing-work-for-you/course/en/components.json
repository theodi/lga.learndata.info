Overall, public perception favours those who publish, regardless of quality, over those who don't.</p><p>Common errors include incorrect content, duplicate entries, missing data, inconsistent use of abbreviations, spelling mistakes and different data formats. In the next section you can find out how to spot these errors in your own data.</p><p>Fortunately there are free, purpose-built cleaning tools designed to deal with messy data. We recommend OpenRefine which can help you quickly and securely clean large datasets. Unlike Excel and other spreadsheet programmes, OpenRefine allows you to record the changes you make and can even automatically apply cleaning functions to other datasets. Importantly, you can share your record of changes with everyone, including other staff, so that your colleagues can benefit from your cleaning.</p><p>To get started with OpenRefine, <a class='course_link' href='http://training.theodi.org/resources/Cleaning_Exercise.pdf' target='_blank'>follow our exercise here.</a></p>"
